    "Ans2) The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:-\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Multiprocessing involves the execution of multiple processes, where each process runs independently and has its own memory space. Processes can communicate with each other using inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading involves the execution of multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and can directly access the variables and data of the process they belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)Each process in multiprocessing typically has its own dedicated resources, such as memory space, file handles, and CPU time. The operating system manages the resources for each process separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads within a process share the same resources, including memory space, file handles, and CPU time. They can access shared data directly, which can lead to synchronization issues that need to be carefully managed\n",
    "\n",
    "iii)Processes communicate with each other using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes, shared memory, or message queues. Synchronization between processes often requires explicit coordination using tools like locks, semaphores, or events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads within a process can communicate with each other more easily since they share the same memory space. However, shared data access needs to be synchronized to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency. This can be achieved using synchronization primitives like locks, mutexes, and condition variables."
